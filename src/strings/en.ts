    summary:
      "Atratus trains a dedicated ensemble - CatBoost, LSTM, Transformer and TCN - for each of ~208 markets across crypto, US, European and Russian equities, indices, forex and commodities. A walk-forward backtest with commissions, slippage and a leakage embargo picks the champion; its probabilities are calibrated against realized moves, sized by Kelly, and gated by a Taleb tail-risk index. A FastAPI dashboard reads the results instantly, and an autonomous, statistically-gated research agent keeps looking for genuine edge - without ever touching production on its own.",
